ng-src & ng-href
  src="/images/cats/{{favoriteCat}}" might not work well
    browsers are aggressive about loading images parallel to other content, angular doesn't get a chance to intercept data binding requests.

Expressions
  Goal
    create hooks between template, application logic and data
    prevent application logic from sneaking into the template
  Usage
    mathematic operations   +, -, /, *, %
    comparisons             ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
    boolean logic           &&, ||, !
    bitwise operations      \^, &, |
    call functions exposed on $scope in controller
    reference arrays and object notation    [], {}, .
  parsing
    computed with angular custom parser not with eval()
    more restrictive
    more forgiving to undefined and null
    no NullPointerException error, Template will simply render nothing
    allows to safely use model values that havn't been set yet
